# How I Git

People that I work with will frequently suggest to me that I write something about my git workflow(s). Historically, I have hesitated to do this for a few reasons.

First, "it depends." Given the nature of the project, the team culture, non-functional requirements like audits and compliance, and a general feeling that there are (over) 9000 ways to do anything with git, a **discussion** is typically the most effective way forward.

Second, I'm not convinced that I have anything new to say.

Third, I'm always learning! What I said to my team three years ago is very different from what I'll say today.

To mitigate these hesitations, I'm going to attempt to frame my thoughts here as if they were one of those discussions with my team. I'll also start out by redirecting you to the resources which I commonly recommend. I hope to continue adding and updating as I learn more, rethink things, or people ask about another topic. [Issues](https://github.com/druttka/how-i-git/issues) will be enabled, so that can be an effective way for anyone to ask questions or bring up additional discussion points.

Through it all, keep in mind that this is only me sharing what has worked for me over the years. Please evaluate what works best for you and for your teams.

## My Git Learning Path (Prerequisites)

When I help someone through an "interesting" situation with git, there are a few concepts that very frequently come up. Sometimes, after covering these concepts, people come to their own solution or answer their own question. When we do have continued discussions, it's much easier because we have a shared context.

Given that experience, before discussing concrete workflows I feel that it's important to establish that same shared context. Before continuing, please take a look at my thoughts on [an effective git learning path](./my-git-learning-path.md).

## My Git Workflows

I'll be filling these out as soon as time allows, but I wanted to establish a roadmap.

> For most of these topics, the short answer will be "it depends." Expect a **discussion of whens, whys, and tradeoffs.**

- What about the [command line versus graphical tools](./cli-vs-graphical.md)?
- What about making [commits](./commits.md)?
- What about branching strategies like:
    - partying directly on the mainline (aka trunk based)?
    - [gitflow](https://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/)?
    - [GitHub flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/)?
- What about forks?
- What about rebase versus merge?
- What about squashing?
